### What is OmniThreadLibrary?

OmniThreadLibrary is a simple to use threading library for Delphi. OTL's main "selling" points (besides the prices, of course ;) are power, simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages and more. OTL doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness" and replace it with your own code.

### How do I use OmniThreadLibrary?

Download and install the sources. Compile and install the OmniThreadLibrary package. Read the tutorials. Examine the demos, which are part of the OmniThreadLibrary download.

### Is OmniThreadLibrary supported on my platform?

At the moment, OTL supports Delphi 2007, 2009, 2010, XE, XE2, XE3, XE4, XE5, XE6, XE7, and XE8 on Win32 and Win64 platforms using the VCL framework. There are no plans to support older Delphi compilers. OS X and FireMonkey will probably be supported in the future, but there are no specific plans for them yet.

### How do I get support?

Support is provided through the [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/112307748950248514961https://plus.google.com/communities/112307748950248514961).
