! Fixed bugs in TOmniInterfaceDictionary which caused scheduled tasks not to be destroyed
  until the program was terminated. [tnx to Zarko]
+ Implemented simplified versions of Atomic<T:class,constructor>.Initialize and Locked<T:class,constructor>.Initialize that work on D2010 and newer. Great thanks to [TOndrej] and [cjsalamon] for helping with the tricky parts!
! Fixed race condition between TOmniTask.Execute and TOmniTask.Terminate. [tnx to Zarko]
! Under some circumstances ProcessMessage failed to rebuild handle array before waiting which could cause 'invalid handle' error.
- Atomic<T>, Locked<T>.
- TOmniValue can store records by using FromRecord<T> and AsRecord<T>.
- Added a class which can wrap any record - TOmniRecordWrapper<T>.
- Added an interface which can wrap any object and destroy it when the
  interface goes out of scope - IOmniAutoDestroyObject.
- Fixed wrong order in teardown sequence in TOmniTask.Execute which could cause access
  violation crash. Great thanks to [Anton Alisov] for providing a reproducible test case.
- Fixed invalid "A call to an OS function failed" error in DispatchEvent.
- TOmniMessageQueue.Enqueue leaked if queue was full and value contained reference counted
  value (found by [meishier]).
- Number of producers/consumers in TOmniForkJoin<T>.StartWorkerTasks was off by 1 
  (found by [meishier]).
- New demos:
  - 49_FramedWorkers: Multiple frames each communication with own worker task.
  - 50_OmniValueArray: http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/11/tomnivalue-handles-arrays-hashes-and.html
  - 51_PipelineStressTest: [Anton Alisov]
  - 52_BackgrondWorker

2.2 2011-10-07
- New features:
  - Delphi XE2 support (Windows 32-bit only).
  - Parallel.Task can be used to execute multiple copies of a common code.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/09/life-after-21-parallel-data-production.html]
  - Breaking change! Parallel.Join reimplemented as IOmniParallelJoin interface
    to add exception and cancellation support. User code must call .Execute on the
    interface returned from the Parallel.Join to start the execution.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/07/life-after-21-paralleljoins-new-clothes.html]
  - Added exception handling to Parallel.Join. Tasks' fatal exceptions are wrapped
    in EJoinException and raised at the end of Parallel.Join method (or when WaitFor is
    called if Join is executed with the .NoWait modifier).
  - Added exception handling to IOmniFuture<T>. Tasks' fatal exception is raised
    in .Value. New function .FatalException and .DetachException.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/07/life-after-21-exceptions-in.html]
  - Two version of Parallel.Async (the ones with explicit termination handlers)
    were removed as this functionality can be achieved by using
    Parallel.TaskConfig.OnTerminated.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/07/life-after-21-async-redux.html]
  - Parallel.Join(const task: TOmniTaskDelegate) is no longer supported. It was
    replaced with the Parallel.Join(const task: IOmniJoinState).
  - Parallel.Join no longer supports taskConfig parameter (replaced by the
    IOmniParallelJoin.TaskConfig function).
  - Number of simultaneously executed task in Parallel.Join may be set by calling
    the new IOmniParallelJoin.NumTasks function.
  - Implemented TOmni[Base]Queue.IsEmpty. Keep in mind that the returned value may not be
    valid for any ammount of time if other threads are reading from/writing to the queue.
  - Implemented another IOmniTaskControl.OnTerminated overload acception parameterless
    anonymous function.
  - Implemented [I|T]OmniBlockingCollection.IsFinalized.
  - Parallel.Pipeline accepts 'simple stage' (for loop implemented internally).
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/09/life-after-21-pimp-my-pipeline.html]
  - TOmniValue can natively store exception objects (AsException, IsException).
  - Implemented IOmniBlockingCollection.ReraiseExceptions. If enabled
    (default: disabled), [Try]Take will check if returned value for exception
    (TOmniValue.IsException) and if true, it will reraise this exception
    instead of returning a result.
  - Assertions are enabled in OTLOptions.inc - OtlContainers needs them.
- Bug fixes:
  - Event monitor in connection to the thread pool was totally broken. 
    (Big thanks to [anton alisov] for finding the problem.)
  - Fixed [Try]Add/CompleteAdding/[Try]Take three-thread race condition in
    TOmniBlockingCollection.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/08/multithreading-is-hard.html]    
- New demos:
  - 48_OtlParallelExceptions: Exception handling in high-level OTL constructs.    
  
2.1 2011-07-19
- New features:
  - Parallel.Async can be used to start simple background tasks.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/04/simple-background-tasks-with.html]
  - Parallel.ForkJoin - divide and conquer (fork/join) framework.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/05/divide-and-conquer-in-parallel.html]
  - OtlParallel tasks can be configured with Parallel.TaskConfig; you can also
    use it to communicated with the owner thread from the task.
    http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/04/configuring-background-otlparallel.html
  - IOmniTask[Control] can call Invoke method to asynchronously execute a block
    of code in the other thread.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/03/synchronize-comes-to-omnithreadlibrary.html]
  - Passes timer ID to timer proc if it accepts const TOmniValue parameter.
  - Support for non-silent exceptions removed.
  - Added property IOmniTaskControl.FatalExecption containing exception that was 
    caught at the task level.
  - Change signature for exception filters in OtlHook.FilterException.
  - IOmniTaskControl termination empties task message queue and calls appropriate
    OnMessage handlers.
- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed race condition in TOmniTask.Execute.
  - OtlParallel compiles in Delphi 2009.
  - OTL monitor message window could be used after it was destroyed.
  - Parallel.ForEach was never running on more than Process.Affinity.Count tasks.
  - OtlParallel pools are created on the fly - Otlparallel unit can be used from a DLL.
  - [dottor_jeckill] Bug fix: TOmniResourceCount.TryAllocate always returned False.
  - Enumerating over TOmniTaskControlList (for example when using
    IOmniTaskGroup.SendToAll) leaked one object.
  - Makes sure timers are called even if there's a constant stream of messages in 
    registered message queues.
  - Fixed exception handling in the thread pool.
- New demos:
  - 43_InvokeAnonymous: Demo for IOmniTaskControl.Invoke and IOmniTask.Invoke.
  - 44_Fork-Join QuickSort: QuickSort implemented with Parallel.ForkJoin.
  - 45_Fork-Join max: Selecting maximum element in an array using Parallel.ForkJoin.
  - 46_Async: Demo for Parallel.Async.
  - 47_TaskConfig: Demo for Parallel.TaskConfig.

  parameter. The old SetTimer assumes timerID = 0.
- IOmniTask/IOmniTaskControl:
  - ParamByName has been removed, use .Param[name: string].
  - Param returns TOmniValueContainter.

- TOmniThreadPool: ThreadDataFactory can now accept either a function or a method
  (but can be used only as a method - SetThreadDataFactory).
- TOmniEventMonitor: Message retrieving loop destroys interface immediately, not when the
  next message is received.
- TOmniTaskFunction renamed to TOmniTaskDelegate.

- Bug fixed: TOmniTaskControl.OnMessage(eventHandler: TOmniTaskMessageEvent) 
  was broken.
- Bug fixed: TOmniTaskControl.OnMessage/OnTerminate uses event monitor 
  created in the context of the task controller thread (was using global 
  event monitor created in the main thread).
- Implemented TOmniEventMonitorPool, per-thread TOmniEventMonitor allocator.

1.05: 2010-02-25
- Big rename: TOmniBaseStack -> TOmniBaseBoundedStack,
  TOmniStack -> TOmniBoundedStack, TOmniBaseQueue -> TOmniBaseBoundedQueue,

- Current versions of 3rd party units included.

1.04: 2009-11-23
*** COMPATIBILITY ISSUES ***
  *** Changed semantics in comm event notifications! When you get the 'new message'
      event, read all messages from the queue in a loop!
  *** Message is passed to the TOmniEventMonitor.OnTaskMessage handler. There's no need
      to read from Comm queue in the handler.
  *** Exceptions in tasks are now visible by default. To hide them, use
      IOmniTaskControl.SilentExceptions. Test 13_Exceptions was improved to demonstrate
      this behaviour.
- Works with Delphi 2010.
- Default communication queue size reduced to 1000 messages.
- Support for 'wait and send' in IOmniCommunicationEndpoint.SendWait.
- Communication subsystem implements observer pattern.
- WideStrings can be send over the communication channel.
- New event TOmniEventMonitor.OnTaskUndeliveredMessage is called after the task is
  terminated for all messages still waiting in the message queue.
- Implemented automatic event monitor with methods IOmniTaskControl.OnMessage and
  OnTerminated. Both support 'procedure of object' and 'reference to procedure'
  parameters.

  TOmniMREW - very simple and extremely fast multi-reader-exclusive-writer - and atomic
  CompareAndSwap functions.
- New unit OtlHooks contains API that can be used by external libraries to hook into
  OTL thread creation/destruction process and into exception chain.
- All known bugs fixed.

- Bug fixed: TOmniTaskControl.Schedule always scheduled task to the global 
  thread pool.
- Current versions of 3rd party units included.

1.0a: 2008-09-02
- TGp4AlignedInt from GpStuff.pas is supposedly D2006 compatible (says a reader) 
  so it has been enabled on that plaform. As a result, it is now possible to 
  compiled and use OTL in D2006 (said the same source).
- SpinLock.pas has been updated.
- Test 6 has been changed to show why one would want to use 
  IOmniWorker.Implementor function.
