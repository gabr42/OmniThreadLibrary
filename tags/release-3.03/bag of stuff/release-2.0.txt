mniThreadLibrary 2.0 has just been released. It is available via
SVN (http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-2.0) 
or as a ZIP archive
(http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/files/OmniThreadLibrary-2.0.zip).

What is OmniThreadLibrary?
==========================

OmniThreadLibrary is simple to use threading library for Delphi. It's
main "selling" points (besides the price, of course  are power,
simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up
multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages
and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not
powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness"
and replace it with your own code. If you don't like working with 
threads - no problem! You can use high-level primitives like parallel
for, futures and pipelines to introduce parallelism into your application.

OmniThreadLibrary is an open source project. It lives in the Google
Code and is licensed under the BSD license.

At the moment, OmniThreadLibrary supports Delphi 2007, 2009, 2010, and 
XE on the Win32 platform. Currently, there are no plans to support older
Delphi compilers and .NET.

Changes since version 1.05a
===========================

- New high-level primitives (unit OtlParallel):
  - Improved parallel for (Parallel.ForEach).
    http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2010/06/omnithreadlibrary-20-sneak-preview-1.html
  - Futures (Parallel.Future<T>).
    http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2010/06/future-of-delphi.html
  - Pipelines (Parallel.Pipeline).
    http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2010/11/multistage-processes-with.html
    
- Added support for multiple simultaneous timers. SetTimer takes additional 
  'timerID' parameter. The old SetTimer assumes timerID = 0.
  
- IOmniTask/IOmniTaskControl:
  - ParamByName has been removed, use .Param[name: string].
  - Param returns TOmniValueContainter.
  
- IOmniTaskControl.OnMessage also accepts an object (message dispatcher).

- TOmniValueContainer:
  - IndexOfName renamed to TOmniValueContainer.IndexOf.
  - New methods in TOmniValueContainer class: ByName, Count, Exists. 
    New properties: Items[integer], Items[string] and Items[TOmniValue].
    
- TOmniValue:
  - Fixed memory leak when sending String, WideString, Variant and Extended values 
    over the communication channel and when queueing them into TOmni[Base]Queue.
  - Implemented _AddRef, _Release, _ReleaseAndClear.
  - TOmniValue can be cast as Int64.
  - Implemented conversions to/from TValue (Delphi 2010 and newer).
  - Implemented constructor.
  - [scarre] Added TDateTime support.
  
- New classes and interfaces:
  - TOmniMessageQueueTee
  - IOmniCommDispatchingObserver
  - TOmniCounter, auto-initialized wrapper around the IOmniCounter
  - TOmniMessageID record, used internally to implement timers.
  
- TOmniThreadPool: ThreadDataFactory can now accept either a function or a method
  (but can be used only as a method - SetThreadDataFactory).
  
- TOmniEventMonitor: Message retrieving loop destroys interface immediately, 
  not when the next message is received.
  
- TOmniTaskFunction renamed to TOmniTaskDelegate.

- Added function CreateResourceCount(initialCount): IOmniResourceCount.

- Renamed IOmniCancellationToken.IsSignaled -> IsSignalled.

- .dproj tests renamed to .2007.dproj.

- Added Delphi XE project files.

- Bugs fixed:
  - Thread pool was immediately closing unused threads if MaxExecuting was 
    set to -1.
  - Ugly bugs in TOmniBlockingCollection removed.
  
- New demos:
  38_OrderedFor: Ordered parallel for loops.
  39_Future: Futures.
  40_Mandelbrot: Parallel graphics demo (very simple).
  41_Pipeline: Pipelines.
  42_MessageQueue: Stress tests for TOmniMessageQueue.
