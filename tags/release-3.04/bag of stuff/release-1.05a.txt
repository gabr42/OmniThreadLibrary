What is OmniThreadLibrary?
==========================

OmniThreadLibrary is simple to use threading library for Delphi. It's
main "selling" points (besides the price, of course  are power,
simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up
multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages
and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not
powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness"
and replace it with your own code.

OmniThreadLibrary is an open source project. It lives in the Google
Code and is licensed under the BSD license.

At the moment, OmniThreadLibrary supports Delphi 2007, 2009, and 2010 
on the Win32 platform. Currently, there are no plans to support older
Delphi compilers and .NET.

Changes since version 1.05
===========================

- Bug fixed: TOmniTaskControl.OnMessage(eventHandler: 
  TOmniTaskMessageEvent) was broken.
- Bug fixed: TOmniTaskControl.OnMessage/OnTerminate uses event monitor 
  created in the context of the task controller thread (was using 
  global event monitor created in the main thread).
- Implemented TOmniEventMonitorPool, per-thread TOmniEventMonitor 
  allocator.
