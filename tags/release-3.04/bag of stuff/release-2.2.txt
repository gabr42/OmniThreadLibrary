OmniThreadLibrary 2.2 has just been released. It is available via
SVN (http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-2.2) 
or as a ZIP archive
(http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/files/OmniThreadLibrary-2.2.zip).
UML diagrams for this release are available (thanks to Rich Shealer) 
as a ZIP archive
(http://code.google.com/p/omnithreadlibrary/downloads/detail?name=OmniThreadLibrary-UML-2.2.zip).

What is OmniThreadLibrary?
==========================

OmniThreadLibrary is simple to use threading library for Delphi. It's
main "selling" points (besides the price, of course  are power,
simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up
multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages
and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not
powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness"
and replace it with your own code. If you don't like working with 
threads - no problem! You can use high-level primitives like parallel
for, futures and pipelines to introduce parallelism into your application.

OmniThreadLibrary is an open source project. It lives in the Google
Code and is licensed under the BSD license.

At the moment, OmniThreadLibrary supports Delphi 2007, 2009, 2010, XE,
and XE2 on the Win32 platform. Currently, there are no plans to support 
older Delphi compilers and .NET. XE2 support is limited to 32-bit Windows
target.

Where can I get more imformation?

Changes since version 2.1
===========================

- New features:
  - Delphi XE2 support (Windows 32-bit only).
  - Parallel.Task can be used to execute multiple copies of a common
    code.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/09/life-after-21-parallel-data-production.html]
  - Breaking change! Parallel.Join reimplemented as IOmniParallelJoin
    interface to add exception and cancellation support. User code must
    call .Execute on the interface returned from the Parallel.Join to
    start the execution.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/07/life-after-21-paralleljoins-new-clothes.html]
  - Added exception handling to Parallel.Join. Tasks' fatal exceptions
    are wrapped in EJoinException and raised at the end of Parallel.Join
    method (or when WaitFor is called if Join is executed with the
    .NoWait modifier).
  - Added exception handling to IOmniFuture<T>. Tasks' fatal exception
    is raised in .Value. New function .FatalException and
    .DetachException.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/07/life-after-21-exceptions-in.html]
  - Two version of Parallel.Async (the ones with explicit termination
    handlers) were removed as this functionality can be achieved by
    using Parallel.TaskConfig.OnTerminated.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/07/life-after-21-async-redux.html]
  - Parallel.Join(const task: TOmniTaskDelegate) is no longer supported.
    It was replaced with the Parallel.Join(const task: IOmniJoinState).
  - Parallel.Join no longer supports taskConfig parameter (replaced by
    the IOmniParallelJoin.TaskConfig function).
  - Number of simultaneously executed task in Parallel.Join may be set
    by calling the new IOmniParallelJoin.NumTasks function.
  - Implemented TOmni[Base]Queue.IsEmpty. Keep in mind that the returned
    value may not be valid for any amount of time if other threads are
    reading from/writing to the queue.
  - Implemented another IOmniTaskControl.OnTerminated overload acception
    parameterless anonymous function.
  - Implemented [I|T]OmniBlockingCollection.IsFinalized.
  - Parallel.Pipeline accepts 'simple stage' (for loop implemented
    internally).
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/09/life-after-21-pimp-my-pipeline.html]
  - TOmniValue can natively store exception objects (AsException,
    IsException).
  - Implemented IOmniBlockingCollection.ReraiseExceptions. If enabled
    (default: disabled), [Try]Take will check if returned value for
    exception (TOmniValue.IsException) and if true, it will reraise this
    exception instead of returning a result.
  - Assertions are enabled in OTLOptions.inc - OtlContainers needs them.
  
- Bug fixes:
  - Event monitor in connection to the thread pool was totally broken. 
    (Big thanks to [anton alisov] for finding the problem.)
  - Fixed [Try]Add/CompleteAdding/[Try]Take three-thread race condition
    in TOmniBlockingCollection.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/08/multithreading-is-hard.html]    
    
- New demos:
  - 48_OtlParallelExceptions: Exception handling in high-level OTL
    constructs.
