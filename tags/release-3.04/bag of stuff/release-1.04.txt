OmniThreadLibrary 1.04 has just been released. It is available via
SVN (http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-1.04) or
as a ZIP archive (http://code.google.com/p/omnithreadlibrary/downloads/list).

What is OmniThreadLibrary?
==========================

OmniThreadLibrary is simple to use threading library for Delphi. It's
main "selling" points (besides the price, of course  are power,
simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up
multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages
and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not
powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness"
and replace it with your own code.

OmniThreadLibrary is an open source project. It lives in the Google
Code and is licensed under the BSD license.

At the moment, OmniThreadLibrary supports Delphi 2007, 2009, and 2010 
on the Win32 platform. Currently, there are no plans to support older
Delphi compilers and .NET.

Where can I get more imformation?

Changes since version 1.03
==========================

*** COMPATIBILITY ISSUES ***
  *** Changed semantics in comm event notifications! When you get the
      'new message' event, read all messages from the queue in a loop!
  *** Message is passed to the TOmniEventMonitor.OnTaskMessage handler.
      There's no need to read from Comm queue in the handler.
  *** Exceptions in tasks are now visible by default. To hide them, use
      IOmniTaskControl.SilentExceptions. Test 13_Exceptions was improved 
      to demonstrate this behaviour.
      
- Works with Delphi 2010.
- Default communication queue size reduced to 1000 messages.
- Support for 'wait and send' in IOmniCommunicationEndpoint.SendWait.
- Communication subsystem implements observer pattern.
- WideStrings can be send over the communication channel.
- New event TOmniEventMonitor.OnTaskUndeliveredMessage is called after the
  task is terminated for all messages still waiting in the message queue.
- Implemented automatic event monitor with methods
  IOmniTaskControl.OnMessage and OnTerminated. Both support 
  'procedure of object' and 'reference to procedure' parameters.
- Implemented IOmniTaskControl.Unobserved behaviour modifier.
- New unit OtlSync contains (old) TOmniCS and IOmniCriticalSection together
  with (new) TOmniMREW - very simple and extremely fast 
  multi-reader-exclusive-writer - and atomic CompareAndSwap functions.
- New unit OtlHooks contains API that can be used by external libraries to
  hook into OTL thread creation/destruction process and into exception chain.
- All known bugs fixed.
- New demos:
  - 25_WaitableComm: Demo for ReceiveWait and SendWait.
  - 26_MultiEventMonitor: How to run multiple event monitors in parallel.
  - 27_RecursiveTree: Parallel tree processing.
  - 28_Hooks: Demo for the new hook system.
  - 29_ImplicitEventMonitor: Demo for OnMessage and OnTerminated, named
    method approach.
  - 30_AnonymousEventMonitor: Demo for OnMessage and OnTerminated, anonymous
    method approach.
