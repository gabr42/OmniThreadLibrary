OmniThreadLibrary is simple to use threading library for Delphi. It's
main "selling" points (besides the price, of course  are power,
simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up
multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages
and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not
powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness"
and replace it with your own code.

OmniThreadLibrary is an open source project. It lives in the Google
Code and is licensed under the BSD license.
OmniThreadLibrary 1.0 is available via SVN
(http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-1.0) or as a
ZIP archive
(http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/files/OmniThreadLibrary-1.0.zip).

At the moment, OmniThreadLibrary supports Delphi 2007 on the Win32
platform. It will support Delphi 2009 as soon as it's available.
Currently, there are no plans to support older Delphi compilers and
.NET.
