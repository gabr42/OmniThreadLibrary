OmniThreadLibrary 1.05 has just been released. It is available via
SVN (http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-1.05) or
as a ZIP archive
(http://code.google.com/p/omnithreadlibrary/downloads/list).

What is OmniThreadLibrary?
==========================

OmniThreadLibrary is simple to use threading library for Delphi. It's
main "selling" points (besides the price, of course  are power,
simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up
multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages
and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not
powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness"
and replace it with your own code.

OmniThreadLibrary is an open source project. It lives in the Google
Code and is licensed under the BSD license.

At the moment, OmniThreadLibrary supports Delphi 2007, 2009, and 2010 
on the Win32 platform. Currently, there are no plans to support older
Delphi compilers and .NET.

Where can I get more imformation?

Changes since version 1.05
===========================

- Big rename: TOmniBaseStack -> TOmniBaseBoundedStack,
  TOmniStack -> TOmniBoundedStack, 
  TOmniBaseQueue -> TOmniBaseBoundedQueue, 
  TOmniQueue -> TOmniBoundedQueue, 
  IInterfaceDictionary -> IOmniInterfaceDictionary, 
  IInterfaceDictionaryEnumerator -> IOmniInterfaceDictionaryEnumerator,
  TInterfaceDictionaryPair -> TOmniInterfaceDictionaryPair.
  
- Implemented dynamically allocated, O(1) enqueue and dequeue, 
  threadsafe, microlocking queue. Class TOmniBaseQueue (unit 
  OtlContainers) contains base implementation while TOmniQueue adds 
  notification support.
  More info: http://17slon.com/blogs/gabr/2010/02/dynamic-lock-free-queue-doing-it-right.html
  
- Implemented resource counter (inverse semaphore) with empty state 
  signalling - TOmniResourceCount (unit OtlSync).
  More info: http://17slon.com/blogs/gabr/2010/01/three-steps-to-blocking-collection-1.html
  
- New unit OtlCollection which contains blocking collection implementation
  TOmniBlockingCollection.
  More info: http://17slon.com/blogs/gabr/2010/02/three-steps-to-blocking-collection-3.html
  
- New high-level parallelism support (unit OtlParallel). Requires at least 
  Delphi 2009.
  - Parallel.ForEach wrapper.
  - Parallel.Join wrapper.
  More info: http://17slon.com/blogs/gabr/2010/02/parallelforeachaggregate.html,
  http://17slon.com/blogs/gabr/2010/02/three-steps-to-blocking-collection-3.html

- Implemented IOmniEnvironment interface and function Environment 
  (unit OtlCommon) returning some information on system, process and 
  thread.

- Implemented IOmniCancellationToken, used in Parallel infrastructure 
  and in IOmniTaskControl.TerminateWhen.
- IOmniTaskControl and IOmniTask implement CancellationToken: 
  IOmniCancellationToken property which can be used by the task and 
  task controller.

- IOmniTask implements Implementor property which points back to the 
  worker instance (but only if worker is TOmniWorker-based).
  
- Implemented IOmniTaskControl.UserData[]. The application can store 
  any values in this array. It can be accessed via the integer or 
  string index.
  
- Implemented TOmniValue.IsInteger.

- IOmniTaskControl implements OnMessage(msgID, handler).

- Refactored and enhanced TOmniValueContainer.

- TOmniTaskFunction now takes 'const' parameter.

- Bugs fixed:
  - TOmniEventMonitor.OnTaskUndeliveredMessage was missing 'message' parameter.
  - Set package names and designtime/runtime type in D2009/D2010 packages.
  
- New demos:
  - 32_Queue: Stress test for new TOmniBaseQueue and TOmniQueue.
  - 33_BlockingCollection: Stress test for new TOmniBlockingCollection, also demoes
    the use of Environment to set process affinity.
  - 34_TreeScan: Parallel tree scan using TOmniBlockingCollection.
  - 35_ParallelFor: Parallel tree scan using Parallel.ForEach (Delphi 2009 and newer).
  - 36_ParallelAggregate: Parallel calculations using Parallel.ForEach.Aggregate
    (Delphi 2009 and newer).
  - 37_ParallelJoin: Parallel.Join demo.
