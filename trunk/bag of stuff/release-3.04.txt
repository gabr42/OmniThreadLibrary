OmniThreadLibrary 3.04 has just been released. It is available via
SVN (http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-3.04)
or as a ZIP archive
(https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwqVlLNTK4OxVEgzZnZGM1FNMGc&usp=sharing#list).

What is OmniThreadLibrary?
==========================

OmniThreadLibrary is simple to use threading library for Delphi. It's
main "selling" points (besides the price, of course are power,
simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up
multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages
and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not
powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness"
and replace it with your own code. If you don't like working with
threads - no problem! You can use high-level primitives like parallel
for, futures and pipelines to introduce parallelism into your
application.

OmniThreadLibrary is an open source project. It lives in the Google
Code and is licensed under the BSD license.

At the moment, OmniThreadLibrary supports Delphi 2007, 2009, 2010, XE,
XE2, XE3, XE4, XE5, XE6, and XE6 onn the Win32 and Win64 platforms. 
Currently, there are no plans to support older Delphi compilers and .NET. 
XE2+ support is limited to Windows targets. Firemonkey is currently not 
supported.

Changes since version 3.04
===========================

- New features:
  - Implemented simple and fast Parallel.&For which supports only integer ranges.
  - Implemented Parallel.Map.
  - Added overloaded Execute methods to IOmniParallelInitializedLoop and
    IOmniParallelInitializedLoop<T> so that IOmniTask parameter can be passed
    to the executor.
  - Implemented Run overloads that internally call Invoke to start
    thread worker.
  - Implemented TOmniValue.HasArrayItem.
  - Implemented TWaitFor which supports waiting any/all and is not
    limited to 63 objects.
  - IOmniTaskControl can wait on any number of comm handles and wait objects.
    That enables support for >60 tasks in the OtlThreadPool. 
  - Implemented TOmniBlockingCollection.ToArray<T>.
  - NumTasks parameter (OtlParallel) can be negative. In that case, specified 
    number of cores will be reserved for other purposes and all other will 
    be used for processing.
    Example: If NumTasks(-2) is used when process has access to 8 cores,
    6 of them (8 - 2) will be used to run the task.  
  - Removed project groups.
  - Tested with 2007-XE7.

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed race condition in IOmniPipeline termination code [tnx to Dean Hill].
  - Creating parameters with the array overload
    (IOmniTaskControl.SetParameters(['From', 0, 'To', 99])) was not working.
  - Fixed problems in demos 33_BlockingCollection and 47_TaskConfig.

- New demos:
  - 55_ForEachProgress: Demonstrates progress bar updating from a ForEach loop.
  - 56_RunInvoke: Simplified 'run & invoke' low-level API.
  - 57_For: Simple and fast parallel for.
  - 58_ForVsForEach: Speed comparison between Parallel.ForEach, Parallel.For, 
    and TParallel.For (XE7+).
  - 59_TWaitFor: Demo for the new TWaitFor class.
  - 60_Map: Demonstrates the new Parallel.Map abstraction.
  - 61_CollectionToArray: Demonstrates the new TOmniBlockingCollection.ToArray<T>
    method.
