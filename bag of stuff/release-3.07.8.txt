What is OmniThreadLibrary?
==========================

OmniThreadLibrary is simple to use threading library for Delphi. It's
main "selling" points (besides the price, of course are power,
simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up
multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages
and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not
powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness"
and replace it with your own code. If you don't like working with
threads - no problem! You can use high-level primitives like parallel
for, futures and pipelines to introduce parallelism into your
application.

OmniThreadLibrary is an open source project. It lives in the Google
Code and is licensed under the BSD license.

At the moment, OmniThreadLibrary supports Delphi 2007, 2009, 2010, XE,
XE2, XE3, XE4, XE5, XE6, XE7, XE8, 10 Seattle, 10.1 Berlin, 10.2 Tokyo, 
10.3 Rio, and 10.4 Sydney on the Win32 and Win64 platforms. 

There are no plans to support older Delphi compilers. XE2+ support 
is limited to Windows targets. Firemonkey is currently not supported.

Changes since version 3.07.7
============================

- New features:
  - Implemented IOmniTask.RegisterWaitObject with an anonymous method callback.
  - [Jacek Laskowski] donated a new OTL icon (res\OTL.ico).
  - Added Delphi 10.4 Syndey packages.
  
- Bug fixes:
  - [sglienke] A reference to an anonymous method executor in IOmniTask is
    cleaned up as soon as possible. This allows OTL tasks to be executed
    from a package. [issue #132]
  - TOmniMREW.TryEnterReadLock and .TryEnterWriteLock were returning True 
    on timeout.
  - SetOnMessage(nil) works correctly.
  - Fixed invalid FreeAndNil of an interface in TOmniFuture<T>.Execute. 
  - Compiles with Delphi 10.4 Sydney.
