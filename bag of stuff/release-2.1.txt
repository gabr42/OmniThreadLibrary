OmniThreadLibrary 2.1 has just been released. It is available via
SVN (http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-2.1) 
or as a ZIP archive
(http://omnithreadlibrary.googlecode.com/files/OmniThreadLibrary-2.1.zip).
UML diagrams for this release are available (thanks to Rich Shealer) 
as a ZIP archive

What is OmniThreadLibrary?
==========================

OmniThreadLibrary is simple to use threading library for Delphi. It's
main "selling" points (besides the price, of course  are power,
simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up
multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages
and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not
powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness"
and replace it with your own code. If you don't like working with 
threads - no problem! You can use high-level primitives like parallel
for, futures and pipelines to introduce parallelism into your application.

OmniThreadLibrary is an open source project. It lives in the Google
Code and is licensed under the BSD license.

At the moment, OmniThreadLibrary supports Delphi 2007, 2009, 2010, and 
XE on the Win32 platform. Currently, there are no plans to support older
Delphi compilers and .NET.

Changes since version 2.0
===========================

- New features:
  - Parallel.Async can be used to start simple background tasks.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/04/simple-background-tasks-with.html]
  - Parallel.ForkJoin - divide and conquer (fork/join) framework.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/05/divide-and-conquer-in-parallel.html]
  - OtlParallel tasks can be configured with Parallel.TaskConfig;
    you can also use it to communicated with the owner thread from 
    the task.
    http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/04/configuring-background-otlparallel.html
  - IOmniTask[Control] can call Invoke method to asynchronously execute 
    a block of code in the other thread.
    [http://www.thedelphigeek.com/2011/03/synchronize-comes-to-omnithreadlibrary.html]
  - Passes timer ID to timer proc if it accepts const TOmniValue 
    parameter.
  - Support for non-silent exceptions removed.
  - Added property IOmniTaskControl.FatalExecption containing exception 
    that was caught at the task level.
  - Change signature for exception filters in OtlHook.FilterException.
  - IOmniTaskControl termination empties task message queue and calls 
    appropriate OnMessage handlers.

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed race condition in TOmniTask.Execute.
  - OtlParallel compiles in Delphi 2009.
  - OTL monitor message window could be used after it was destroyed.
  - Parallel.ForEach was never running on more than 
    Process.Affinity.Count tasks.
  - OtlParallel pools are created on the fly - Otlparallel unit can be 
    used from a DLL.
  - [dottor_jeckill] Bug fix: TOmniResourceCount.TryAllocate always 
    returned False.
  - Enumerating over TOmniTaskControlList (for example when using
    IOmniTaskGroup.SendToAll) leaked one object.
  - Makes sure timers are called even if there's a constant stream of 
    messages in registered message queues.
  - Fixed exception handling in the thread pool.
  
- New demos:
  - 43_InvokeAnonymous: Demo for IOmniTaskControl.Invoke and     
    IOmniTask.Invoke.
  - 44_Fork-Join QuickSort: QuickSort implemented with 
    Parallel.ForkJoin.
  - 45_Fork-Join max: Selecting maximum element in an array using 
    Parallel.ForkJoin.
  - 46_Async: Demo for Parallel.Async.
  - 47_TaskConfig: Demo for Parallel.TaskConfig.
